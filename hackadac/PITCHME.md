#### Context
- Modern day SoCs incorporate hundreds of third party IPs.
- All these IPs are specified/design separately.
- Security bugs arise from their interaction.
- The goal is to find secuirty bugs during design/integration phase.
---

#### First Things First: The Attacker Model

- A clear idea of what are protecting and from whom ?
- What would we like to have:
	- Divide the attacker spaces into several sets. not necessarlily disjoint.
`$${A_0,A_1\ldots A_n} $$`

	- clearly specify each set with SystemVerilog Assertions.
	-e.g simple hardware adversary: 
---
#### First Things First: The Security Objective
- Specification of Security objectives with assertions:
- For memory mapped SoCs we have
	- A set of memory zones `$${M_0,M_1\ldots M_n} $$`
	- A set of Attackers/Users `$${A_0,A_1\ldots A_n} $$ 
- Example Security Objectives:
	- `\(A_0,A_5\)` can't acces `\({M_{10},M_{11}}\)`
	- if `\(A_0,A_5\)` access  `\(M_{10}\)` implies `\(\overline{\{A_0,A_5\}}\)`  can't access `\({M_{10},M_{11}}\)`
---
#### First Things First: Bug Classification
- Functional Bugs
	- e.g JTAG port is wide open
	- Protocol Bugs
    - Bugs arising from hardware and software specified separately

- RTL Bugs
	- Arising from poor coding techniques.
	- trying to meet other constraints (e.g timing)



---
#### Our Methods
- Differntial Memory Scan.
	- A way to find functional Bugs.
	- It might also find functional bugs but our main goal is to catch bugs which arise 
from interaction of different hardware/software blocks.
	- RTL is not the best place to find functional bugs.

- Differential Code Coverage.
	- A way to find RTL bugs.
---
#### Differential Memory Scan
- Ponit of Views (POV)
	- Secure Ponit of View
	- Hacker Point of View

-e.g
- In HackaDac we assume simple HW adversary
	- set of attackes `\(A_0\)`=Processor, `\(A_1\)`=JTAG, `\(A_2\)`=SPI, `\(A_3\)`=GPIO
	- Secure POV: Processor/Software `\(A_0\)`
	- Hacker POV: Access from hardware pins. `\({A_1,A_2,A_3}\)`

#### Differential Memory Scan
- More complicated Examples
- Trustzone
	- Secure POV: Software running in Secure World
	- Hacker POV: Software/hardware

#### Our Method Applied to Pulpino
- Found Boot address modification bug
	- The system boots from bootrom 0x8080, and runs.
	- The attacker resets the SoC. and puts it in sleep mode (fetch_enable).
	- The attacker changes the boot address  (e.g 0x4000)  through JTAG.
   		Boot address Register 0x1A107008, P. 27 datasheet.pdf
	- Attacker loads his program through SPI. (spi_load(use_qspi)) in testbench,
   at the same address 0x4000.
	- The attacker brings the SoC out of sleep mode, the SoC will now boot from
   0x4000 with attacker program.

---
#### Differential Code Coverage
- A way to detect RTL Bugs.
- Once a functional bug is detected we can enquire if it is in specification or due to a RTL bug.
- To fond RT trace:
	- first run some random tests and store code coverage.
	- execute the scan from concerned user/attacker model, and store code coverage results.
	- Diff the code coverage to find RTL trail.
	- This process can be further refined with each access. read/write/password etc.   


---
#### Differential Code Coverage
-	Applied differential code coverageto inspect JTAG port vulnerability.
-	Scan through all other ports (SPI,CPU)
-	Store code coverage.
-	several accesses through JTAG port.
-	Manually diff code coverage.

---?code=hackadac/src/jtag.v&lang=verilog&title=Our Method Applied to Pulpino
- during tap reset the password check is set to 1,
- the attacker  will be able to pass one jtag instruction/data,
- the attacker can reset every  time and write unlimited instructions

#### Conclusion
- SoC Designers integrate and create bugs.
- we differentiate and debug.
- Not very different from standard verification methodologies.
- Capable to detect bith functional and RTL bugs.
